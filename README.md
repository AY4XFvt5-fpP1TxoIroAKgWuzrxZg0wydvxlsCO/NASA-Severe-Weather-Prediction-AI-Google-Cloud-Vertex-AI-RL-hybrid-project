### Predicts storm intensity and direction using SAR + reanalysis + RL hybrid modeling.

---

## What It Does
Uses temporal ML (LSTM) trained on SAR and reanalysis data to predict next-step storm intensity and steering angle.  
Reinforcement learning tests sensitivity to SST and wind perturbations.  
Deployed via Vertex AI for scalable inference.

## How It Works
1. Prepares spatiotemporal sequences in BigQuery  
2. Trains LSTM model on storm evolution  
3. Deploys to Vertex AI for online predictions  
4. RL explores causal sensitivities to environmental changes
